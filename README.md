# Animation Experimentation

Each folder contains an individual animation experiment, some include an interactive element. Contents include HTML, CSS/Sass, and JavaScript files.

This is the repo. The animations are shared on at [codepen.io/davewilder](https://codepen.io/davewilder).

1. Drop the Balls

An 2D HTML Canvas experiment where orbs of various sizes behave under a point or vertical gravitational force. They collide with eachother and the bounds of the canvas.

2. Orb in a Force Field

A 2D HTML animation wherein an orb is interacts with a point source. The UI monitors position, velocity and force and allows selection of different types of force.

3. Infinity Loader

A Sass/Compass and JavaScript created infinity loader. Automatically replaces an HTML `progress` element.

4. Refined Infinity Loader

A refinement of the Infinity Loader. Less Sass, less JavaScript, utilizing pseudo-elements to create the indicators.

5. Input-Slider Swap

6. Select-Slider Swap

An experiment in taking a select box and converting it to a slider. Slide positions related to each option.
