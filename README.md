# Animation Experimentation

Each folder contains an individual animation experiment, some include an interactive element. Contents include HTML, CSS/Sass, and JavaScript files.

This is the repo. The animations are shared on at [codepen.io/davewilder](https://codepen.io/davewilder).

[Drop the Balls](https://github.com/dwilder/codepens/tree/main/droptheballs)
